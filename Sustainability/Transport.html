<li> Try to walk for short trips: Walking helps reduce body fat, lower blood pressure and is completely free. </li>
    <br>

      <br>
<li> Cycling: Switching to a 10km journey per week from car to bike will burn around 300 calories each way, saving over 300kg of greenhouse gas emission each year.</li>
    <br>
<li> Flying 'Sustainably' is Possible: Choose Flying is not clean and therefore, it is better to not use it. However, in cases when you want and have to fly, there are ways to fly more 'sustainably'. This is done by taking direct flights When you opt for connecting flights, you have to fly a greater distance. This results in more carbon emissions. Furthermore, choose an airline that is least polluting. For example, KLM relies on biofuels for certain routes, such as the Amsterdam-Los Angeles route. KLM and All Nippon Airway are both in the top 3 of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. This means that, relatively speaking, they are the least polluting airlines.</li>
    <br>
<li> Use Public Transport: Public transportation is one of the most earth-friendly ways to get somewhere fast. With buses nearly matching the speed of cars and some trains exceeding it, the environmental cost of carrying many people all at once is greatly reduced without a major time loss. </li>
    <br>
<li> Low Emission Vehicles: If you buy a car, purchase a fuel efficient and low emission vehicle.You can reduce your impact by employing <a href= "http://www.globalstewards.org/alternative-transportation.htm"> Green Driving techniques. </a>  </li>
